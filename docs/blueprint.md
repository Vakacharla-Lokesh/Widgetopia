## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Off-white (#FAF9F6), providing a neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the widgets.
- Primary color: Soft, desaturated blue (#A7C4BC), evoking a sense of calm and focus.
- Accent color: black (#000000), used sparingly for interactive elements to draw attention without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a modern and clean appearance.
- Use a set of minimalist icons for the widgets, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- The widgets will be arranged in a grid layout, and their dimensions should be integer multiples of the grid unit. This creates a visually balanced and consistent look. Each grid tile should snap, and should align together with its neighbors without gaps, overlaps, or fractional overhangs.
- Employ subtle animations for transitions and interactions, such as a gentle fade-in effect when a widget is added or removed.
